(This is part of an attempt to formalise some material from
 a basic undergraduate combinatorics course.)

 We consider the equation x₀ + ... + xₘ = n, 
 where the variables xᵢ are natural numbers.  
 The set of solutions bijects with the set of 
 (n,m) grid paths, so the number of solutions is 
 (n + m) choose n.

 There are various possible modifications, where 
 we might impose constraints xᵢ ≥ cᵢ for example.
