 A "domino" means a subset of ℕ × ℕ of the form 
 {i} × {j,j+1} or {i,i+1} × {j}.  Given a finite subset 
 B ⊆ ℕ × ℕ, we ask whether B can be written as a disjoint
 union of dominos.  One basic tool that we can use is the
 chessboard colouring map c : ℕ × ℕ → {black,white}.
 (Probably it is more convenient to use bool = {ff,tt} 
 instead of {black,white}.)  If B can be covered by a
 disjoint set of dominos, then it is clear that the 
 number of black squares in B must be equal to the number 
 of white squares.   Examples should be given to show that
 the converse fails.
