 Consider the set (T n) of triples (x,y,z) in ℕ³ with x + y + z = n.
 This can be drawn in an evident way as a triangle with sides of
 length n.  Inside (T n) there are many embedded copies of (T m) 
 for m = 1,..,n, which we call "embedded subtriangles".  The 
 total number of embedded subtriangles is (choose (n + 2) 3).  
 This can be proved in several different ways.
