 Consider the identity
 (choose n k) =  (choose k-1 k-1) + (choose k k-1) + ... + (choose n-1 k-1)

 This can be proved algebraically by induction.  
 Alternatively, we can consider the set (P n k) of 
 subsets A of size k in {0,..,n-1}, so |(P n k)| = (choose n k).
 We can split this set up according to the value of (max A),
 and recover a combinatorial proof of the identity.
