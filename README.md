# Neil Strickland's Lean Library

This contains most of my Lean files, covering various different areas of mathematics.  At the moment I plan to keep everything in a single combined repository.  

* There are various things about combinatorics.  I teach an undergraduate module on this, and hope to formalise all the proofs for that.
* There are a couple of things about commutative algebra.  I would like to extend this, taking a more constructive approach than is currently in mathlib.  I have a set of lecture notes that will serve as a good basis for that.
* There is some group theory: cyclic and dihedral groups, powers by â„¤/n for elements of order n, additional typeclass instances for sets with monoid action, Burnside's orbit counting lemma.
* There are various things about finite posets, focusing on the idea that these can be used as a basis for the homotopy theory of finite simplicial complexes.  
* There are formalisations of a number of exercises from an undergraduate "introduction to proofs" course.
* There is an attempt to do Lean versions of the exercises from Assia Mahboubi's book on Coq's Mathematical Components library.  
* There are lots of miscellaneous things, some of which are intended to fill what seem to me to be holes in mathlib, although there are probably cases in which I am wrong about that.

I would be interested in comments on any of these things.
